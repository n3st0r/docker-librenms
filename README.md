# TL;DR

Here https://github.com/librenms/docker is an interesting project that suggests some interesting solutions to the topic. Unfortunately, none of them meets my expectations in 100%.

At the beginning, part of my project will be based on solutions from the above-mentioned project.
Ultimately, I would like it to be completely my solution.
